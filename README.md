# bankruptcy_prediction
We have been tasked to assess whether a company would bankrupt in the long run.  This is useful because it helps the bank save money from reducing loan defaults.  Due to the highly confidential nature of the bank customer data, we used some publicly available data (as a substitute for the bank’s customer data), to experiment with predictive analytics techniques.  Proxy data used is Taiwanese bankruptcy prediction. We found the dataset titled ‘TEJ - Normalized_2013_0430_Taiwan_data.csv’ on <https://www.kaggle.com/chihfongtsai/taiwanese-bankruptcy-prediction/tasks>.

Our task is to assess whether a company would bankrupt in the long run.  This would tie back to the private bank’s business objective to reduce loan defaults – notably in the collections process (to help identify any problems soonest possible).
